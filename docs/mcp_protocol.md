# Model Context Protocol (MCP)

## Overview

The Model Context Protocol (MCP) is an open standard for connecting AI assistants to systems where data lives, including content repositories, business tools, and development environments. It standardizes how applications provide context to LLMs, acting as a universal connector for AI applications.

## Key Concepts

### Core Components

- **MCP Servers**: Expose data and functionality to LLMs through a standardized interface
- **Resources**: Data sources that AI agents can access (similar to REST API endpoints)
- **Tools**: Functions that AI agents can invoke to perform actions
- **Prompts**: Predefined templates guiding AI models in optimally using tools and resources

### Server Types

MCP defines three types of servers based on transport mechanisms:

1. **stdio servers**: Run as a subprocess of your application (locally)
2. **HTTP over SSE servers**: Run remotely and connected to via a URL
3. **Streamable HTTP servers**: Run remotely using the Streamable HTTP transport

## Protocol Design

- Uses JSON-RPC 2.0 for lightweight, secure messaging
- Provides a unified interface across different data sources and tools
- Enables AI applications to maintain context between different tools and datasets
- Supports synchronous and asynchronous operations

## Benefits

- **Standardization**: Eliminates the need for custom integrations for each data source
- **Simplicity**: Provides a consistent interface for tool and resource access
- **Scalability**: Supports complex workflows across multiple data sources
- **Security**: Defines clear boundaries for data access and tool execution

## Workflow

1. **Connection**: Client initiates connection to discover available tools, resources, and prompts
2. **Invocation**: Client requests data or executes functions via the MCP server
3. **Response**: Server returns data or action results to the client
4. **Processing**: AI agent processes the retrieved data and delivers an appropriate response

## Current Limitations

- Manual server discovery and setup
- Limited multi-tenant support
- Emerging security best practices
- Nascent ecosystem of production-ready MCP servers

## Future Developments

- Server registry and discovery protocol
- Enhanced multi-tenant architectures for SaaS products
- Improved security frameworks
- Broader ecosystem of pre-built MCP servers
